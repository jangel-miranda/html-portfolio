<h1>The Best Movies according to Angel Miranda</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Devil wears Prada</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it is about how someone can put so much effort in their job to succeed and then realize that you can do better.</p>

<h3>Predestination</h3>
<p>It was such a confusing movie. It just blew my mind.</p>

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>I loved it because I got to see the end of a series of movies.</p>
